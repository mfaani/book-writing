## Introduction first

## Side characters. Toys. Teddy Bears...

# Drawing

You can draw a scene in the house. Let it have a wall, background curtains, etc. 
OR JUST not have a background. Let it be a simple white background. This makes the drawing easier. And also adds focus to the main characters. Removes noise from paying attention to the house. 
Obviously if you're outside and playing in the backyard, then things are a bit different.
