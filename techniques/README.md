## Introduction first

## Side characters. Toys. Teddy Bears...

# Build up

Give hints thar for example, mention something related to finding a possible solution. 
Don't go deeper. then 5 pages after, you use your previous hint. 
basically don't just suggest a solution or refer to it and then follow it through. 

often gapping in between is a good idea

# Drawing

You can draw a scene in the house. Let it have a wall, background curtains, etc. 
OR JUST not have a background. Let it be a simple white background. This makes the drawing easier. And also adds focus to the main characters. Removes noise from paying attention to the house. 
Obviously if you're outside and playing in the backyard, then things are a bit different. 

## Rhyming

## Font

Use smaller fonts for things that require to be expressed queitly. Music is quiet

writing vertically. or all over the place. 

vertically I mean like:

dear  
friend
